# Lab7 MadLibs
In Section 2.6 of CSAwesome, there is an activity to create your own Mad Lib.  For this lab, you will create your own Mad Lib, but you need to ask the user to enter the words, not just have them set in the program.
A Mad Lib is a story/template word game.  One player prompts the other for words given a type of speech.  After all the words are collected the story is revealed, substituting the given words for the missing words.  Typically, a wacky but funny story results.

Requirements 
1.	Include your typical header: Name, Assignment and description, date
2.	This Mad Lib must be completely different from the Mad Lib template provided on CSAwesome – it must be unique to you.
3.	The Mad Lib must have at least 5 words read in from the keyboard.
4.	The formatting of the output must follow proper English language syntax (i.e. spaces before and after words.

Note – this lab DOES NOT require methods.  We are practicing using the string methods and practicing reading in words from the keyboard and displaying them in context.
